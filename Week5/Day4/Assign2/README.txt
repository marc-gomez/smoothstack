I feel like running 500 trades each is enough to reach a potential deadlock. A deadlock was found when my program hangs and no more output is printed to cout and I have to ctrl+c to end the program. I fixed the deadlock by using the fixed order locking method. My Countries have an associated id with them and I lock the one with the lowest id first in my no_deadlock program. The program that deadlocks locks the Country that initiates the trade first, which is what creates the deadlock.
